<h1>The Story in the Book</h1>	

<h2>Chapter 01 </h2>

<p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature, New Scientist,</i> and all the other
scientific joumals her work had appeared in, was well thumbed copy of <i>On The Road.</i> It had been <b>M</b>olly's favourite book since college, and the longer she 
spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>	

<p>She had spent the last ten year in this room, sitting under a poster witn an <b>O</b>scar <b>W</b>ilde quote proclaiming that <q><b>W</b>ork is the refuge of people
who have nothing better to do</q> . Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama <b>DNA,</b> to be an outstanding achievement, <b>M</b>olly
<i>did</i> think she had something better to do.
